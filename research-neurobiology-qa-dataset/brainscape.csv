How do voltage gated channels ?,They are very selective due to their gating mechanisms The gate opens/closes based up the potential The pore of these channels have selectivity filters enabling passage of specific ions Gate is connected to a voltage sensor which is sensitive to changes in voltage Gate opens upon conformational changes in the channel
Explain the potassium channel selectivity filter ?,In their pores they have a sequence which is an acidity filter and is highly conserved - TVGYGPotassium ions are surrounded by water molecules making it easier to diffuse in the cytosol The acidity filter in the pore mimics the hydration of the potassium ions so their for the oxygen moieties can interact and allow potassium to diffuse through the channel easily.Sodium also has water molecules surrounding it but because sodium is a smaller molecule the woxygen moieties are too far away to interact so sodium doesn’t pass through the potassium channel
What are the 2 gates present in sodium channels ?,M gate - activation gate which opens upon depolarisation to allow sodium ions to pass through the channel H gate - inactivation gate which activates just after the pore has been open to plug the pore so no more sodium ions can pass through  it remains activate for a while causing he refractory period so there is no more sodium influx
What is the voltage-clamp technique ?,1- an electrode is inserted into the neurone and this measures the membrane potential across it. This electrode is connected to a voltage clamp amplifier 2- voltage clamp amplifier compares the membrane potential of the neuron with the desired membrane potential3- if the membrane potential in the neuron is different from the desired membrane potential then the clamp amplifier injects current through another electrode 4- using a current measured the current which is injected to get the membrane potential to the desired potential is recorded

What is the current clamp technique ?,In this technique the current flowing across the membrane is controlled so the voltage can be recorded Useful for looking at actions potentials
When an action potential occurs why doesn’t the membrane potential reach the equilibrium potential of sodium ?,Because the sodium channels inactivate very quickly - their effects are transient
What is the role of sodium channels in the action potential ?,"They are voltage gated and open upon depolarisationOnce they open they enable and influx of sodium ions and this causes more sodium channels to open, the explosive influx only occurs if the threshold is reached - push the membrane potential towards their equilibrium potential but inactivate rapidly They remain inactivate during the refractory period preventing any further action potentials occurring They inactivate after about 1-2ms"
What is the role of the potassium channels in the action potential ?,The voltage potassium channels also open at depolarisation but at a more positive potential compared to sodium- they have slower kinetics that sodium channels This delayed opening of the potassium channels is fundamental in the repolarisation of the cellAt rest some voltage gated potassium channels are open and leak potassium channels are open and this is important for maintaining the membrane potential at rest
What are calcium-activated potassium channels ?,There are some potassium channels which react to the internal calcium concentration- they contribute to repolarisation of the cellThese channels are often in cells which contain the voltage calcium channels which contribute to depolarisation\nThese channels remain open longer than voltage gated potassium channels which is why they cause he undershoot of the action potential=afterhyperpolarsation

"If the membrane potential is at +70mV and the potassium channels are opened, what happens to the epsc and epsp ?",The epsc will have an upward deflection because potassium ions will be flowing out of the cell to cause an outward current to return membrane potential closer to its equilibrium potential The epsp will be a downward deflection as the outward flow of current will cause the membrane potential to become more negative
"If the membrane potential was at - 70mV and chloride channels were opened, what would happen to the epsc and epsp ?","The epsc would be an upward deflection because chloride ions would be entering the cell The epsp would be a downward deflection because chloride ions would be making the membrane potential ,ore negative"

What happens to off centre bipolar cells when their is light in the centre ?,Photoreceptors is hyperpolarises reducing release of glutamate Less glutamate released onto AMPA kainate and NMDA receptors on bipolar cell so it causes hyperpolarisation of bipolar cellThis causes less release of glutamate from bipolar cell onto ganglion cell so it is also hyperpolarises
What happens to on centre bipolar cells when the centre is in the dark ?,Photoreceptors are depolarised in the dark so release lots of glutamate Glutamate binds to mGluR6 on bipolar cells and this causes closure of sodium channels causing hyperpolarisation of bipolar cellsLess glutamate is therefore released from bipolar cells onto ganglion cells so the ganglion cells are also hyperpolarises
What happens to off centre bipolar cells and ganglion cells when the centre is dark ?,Photoreceptor is depolarised so more glutamate is released More glutamate to act on glutamatertergic receptors on bipolar cell causes bipolar cell to depolarise This causes it to release flu ate onto ganglion cell and cause it to depolarise

Explain long term potentiation,If you repeatedly stimulate the preferent pathway of the ca1 region of the hippocampus then you will repeatedly see EPSPs in the postsynaptic neuron If you then strongly excite the preferent pathway (100Hz for 1-2secs) this causes a conditioning trainImmediately after this conditioning train you see an increase in the size of EPSP\nIt fades away after a while but remains at a higher amplitude for a while Therefore the strength of the synapse has changed so it is believed to be the first steps in forming memory
