This response leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years. SSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is a rare disease. Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally occurs in children and adolescents. Symptoms of SSPE occur in four general stages. With each stage, the symptoms are worse than the stage before: - Stage I: There may be personality changes, mood swings, or depression. Fever and headache may also be present. This stage may last up to 6 months. - Stage II: There may be uncontrolled movement problems including jerking and muscle spasms. Other symptoms that may occur in this stage are loss of vision, dementia, and seizures. - Stage III: Jerking movements are replaced by writhing (twisting) movements and rigidity. Death may occur from complications. - Stage IV: Areas of the brain that control breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged. This leads to coma and then death. There may be a history of measles in an unvaccinated child. A physical examination may reveal: - Damage to the optic nerve, which is responsible for sight - Damage to the retina, the part of the eye that receives light - Muscle twitching - Poor performance on motor (movement) coordination tests The following tests may be performed: - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - Brain MRI - Serum antibody titer to look for signs of previous measles infection - Spinal tap No cure for SSPE exists. However, certain antiviral drugs and drugs that boost the immune system may slow the progression of the disease. SSPE is always fatal. People with this disease die 1 to 3 years after diagnosis. Some people may survive longer. Call your health care provider if your child has not completed their scheduled vaccines. The measles vaccine is included in the MMR vaccine. Immunization against measles is the only known prevention for SSPE. The measles vaccine has been highly effective in reducing the numbers of affected children. Measles immunization should be done according to the recommended American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control schedule. Updated by: Amit M.

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"MTHFR gene variant (Inheritance): Because each person has two copies of the MTHFR gene , people can inherit one copy of a  MTHFR gene variant or two copies of it (one from each parent). People who inherit two copies of C677T have a higher risk for having a child with a neural tube defect. Having two C677T variants and elevated homocysteine levels may cause a slightly higher risk for blood clots. [7]  Risks associated with having one C677T and one A1298C is the same, or possibly slightly lower than, that of having two C677T gene changes. [7] [4] Rare MTHFR gene variants can lead to homocystinuria, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive  manner. [12] Visit our "" Homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency"" webpage."
What is Stroke?,"Stroke: A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. There are two forms of stroke: ischemic - blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic - bleeding into or around the brain. Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual's underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics. Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body. A common disability that results from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called hemiplegia. A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis is one-sided weakness or hemiparesis. Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Stroke survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech. A stroke can lead to emotional problems. Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions. Many stroke patients experience depression. Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange sensations. The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures. Recurrent stroke is frequent; about 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within 5 years."
What causes Stroke?,"Ischemic Stroke (Summary): Summary A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. Symptoms of stroke are - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - Sudden severe headache with no known cause It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
What are the symptoms of Stroke?,"What are the symptoms of Stroke?: The signs and symptoms of a stroke often develop quickly. However, they can develop over hours or even days. The type of symptoms depends on the type of stroke and the area of the brain thats affected. How long symptoms last and how severe they are vary among different people. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include: Sudden weakness Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body Confusion Trouble speaking or understanding speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Problems breathing Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls Loss of consciousness Sudden and severe headache A transient ischemic attack (TIA) has the same signs and symptoms as a stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last less than 12 hours (although they may last up to 24 hours). A TIA may occur only once in a persons lifetime or more often. At first, it may not be possible to tell whether someone is having a TIA or stroke. All stroke-like symptoms require medical care. If you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Stroke Complications After youve had a stroke, you may develop other complications, such as: Blood clots and muscle weakness. Being immobile (unable to move around) for a long time can raise your risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Being immobile also can lead to muscle weakness and decreased muscle flexibility. Problems swallowing and pneumonia. If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You also may be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia. Loss of bladder control. Some strokes affect the muscles used to urinate. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Loss of bowel control or constipation also may occur after a stroke."
What are the treatments of Stroke?,"Stroke (Treatment): A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke. People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot. - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes - Nutrients and fluids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed. The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes. Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home."
What is Dementia?,"Dementia (WHAT IS DEMENTIA?): Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus."
What causes Dementia?,"What causes Dementia?: Dementia usually occurs in older age. It is rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older. Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative). Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia. It is caused by many small strokes. Lewy body disease is a common cause of dementia in the elderly. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: - Huntington disease - Brain injury - Multiple sclerosis - Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis,and Lyme disease - Parkinson disease - Pick disease - Progressive supranuclear palsy Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: - Brain injury - Brain tumors - Chronic alcohol abuse - Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels (dementia due to metabolic causes) - Low vitamin B12 level - Normal pressure hydrocephalus - Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol drugs"
What are the symptoms of Dementia?,"Dementia (Symptoms): Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: - Emotional behavior or personality - Language - Memory - Perception - Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of dementia. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They often know about their forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia. Symptoms of MCI include: - Difficulty doing more than one task at a time - Difficulty solving problems or making decisions - Forgetting recent events or conversations - Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of dementia can include: - Difficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines - Getting lost on familiar routes - Language problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objects - Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood - Misplacing items - Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors As dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: - Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night - Difficulty with basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving - Forgetting details about current events - Forgetting events in one's own life history, losing self-awareness - Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior - Having delusions, depression, agitation - More difficulty reading or writing - Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger - Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences - Withdrawing from social contact People with severe dementia can no longer: - Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing - Recognize family members - Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with dementia: - Problems controlling bowel movements or urine - Swallowing problems"
How to diagnose Dementia?,"Dementia (Diagnosis): Diagnosing dementia and determining what type it is can be challenging. A diagnosis of dementia requires that at least two core mental functions be impaired enough to interfere with daily living. They are memory, language skills, ability to focus and pay attention, ability to reason and problem-solve, and visual perception. Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms and conduct a physical examination. He or she will likely ask someone close to you about your symptoms, as well. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. Cognitive and neuropsychological tests Doctors will evaluate your thinking (cognitive) function. A number of tests measure thinking skills such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Neurological evaluation Doctors evaluate your memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Brain scans - CT or MRI. These scans can check for evidence of stroke or bleeding or tumor or hydrocephalus. - PET scans. These can show patterns of brain activity and if the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, has been deposited in the brain. Laboratory tests Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Sometimes the spinal fluid is examined for infection, inflammation or markers of some degenerative diseases. Psychiatric evaluation A mental health professional can determine whether depression or another mental health condition is contributing to your symptoms."
What causes Alcohol Use Disorder?,"Alcohol use disorder (Causes): Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder. Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones."
What is Parkinson's Disease?,"Parkinson disease: Parkinson disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system. The disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement. Often the first symptom of Parkinson disease is trembling or shaking (tremor) of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. Typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. Tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement (bradykinesia) or an inability to move (akinesia), and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). These symptoms worsen slowly over time. Parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability (cognition). Some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. People with Parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory. Generally, Parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late-onset disease. The condition is described as early-onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. Early-onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile-onset Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease affects more than 1 million people in North America and more than 4 million people worldwide. In the United States, Parkinson disease occurs in approximately 13 per 100,000 people, and about 60,000 new cases are identified each year. The late-onset form is the most common type of Parkinson disease, and the risk of developing this condition increases with age. Because more people are living longer, the number of people with this disease is expected to increase in coming decades. Most cases of Parkinson disease probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. These cases are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. The cause of these sporadic cases remains unclear. Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of this disorder. Familial cases of Parkinson disease can be caused by mutations in the LRRK2, PARK7, PINK1, PRKN, or SNCA gene, or by alterations in genes that have not been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic (not inherited). Alterations in certain genes, including GBA and UCHL1, do not cause Parkinson disease but appear to modify the risk of developing the condition in some families. Variations in other genes that have not been identified probably also contribute to Parkinson disease risk. It is not fully understood how genetic changes cause Parkinson disease or influence the risk of developing the disorder. Many Parkinson disease symptoms occur when nerve cells (neurons) in the substantia nigra die or become impaired. Normally, these cells produce a chemical messenger called dopamine, which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements. When these dopamine-producing neurons are damaged or die, communication between the brain and muscles weakens. Eventually, the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. Some gene mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins in dopamine-producing neurons. As a result, undegraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of these cells. Other mutations may affect the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules called free radicals that can damage cells. Cells normally counteract the effects of free radicals before they cause damage, but mutations can disrupt this process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons. In most cases of Parkinson disease, protein deposits called Lewy bodies appear in dead or dying dopamine-producing neurons. (When Lewy bodies are not present, the condition is sometimes referred to as parkinsonism.) It is unclear whether Lewy bodies play a role in killing nerve cells or if they are part of the cells' response to the disease. Most cases of Parkinson disease occur in people with no apparent family history of the disorder. These sporadic cases may not be inherited, or they may have an inheritance pattern that is unknown. Among familial cases of Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern differs depending on the gene that is altered. If the LRRK2 or SNCA gene is involved, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. If the PARK7, PINK1, or PRKN gene is involved, Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This type of inheritance means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. When genetic alterations modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern is usually unknown. Abou-Sleiman PM, Muqit MM, Wood NW. Expanding insights of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Mar;7(3):207-19. Review."
What are the treatments of Parkinson's Disease?,"Parkinson disease (Treatment): There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatment can help control your symptoms. MEDICINE Your provider will prescribe medicines to help control your shaking and movement symptoms. At certain times during the day, the medicine may wear off and symptoms can return. If this happens, your provider may need to change any of the following: - Type of medicine - Dose - Amount of time between doses - The way you take the medicine You may also need to take medicines to help with: - Mood and thinking problems - Pain relief - Sleep problems - Drooling (botulinum toxin is often used) Parkinson medicines can cause severe side effects, including: - Confusion - Seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations) - Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea - Feeling lightheaded or fainting - Behaviors that are hard to control, such as gambling - Delirium Tell your provider right away if you have these side effects. Never change or stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider. Stopping some medicines for Parkinson disease may lead to a severe reaction. Work with your provider to find a treatment plan that works for you. As the disease gets worse, symptoms such as stooped posture, frozen movements, and speech problems may not respond to the medicines. SURGERY Surgery may be an option for some people. Surgery does not cure Parkinson disease, but it may help ease symptoms. Types of surgery include: - Deep brain stimulation. This involves placing electric stimulators in areas of the brain that control movement. - Surgery to destroy brain tissue that causes Parkinson symptoms. - Stem cell transplant and other procedures are being studied. LIFESTYLE Certain lifestyle changes may help you cope with Parkinson disease: - Stay healthy by eating nutritious foods and not smoking. - Make changes in what you eat or drink if you have swallowing problems. - Use speech therapy to help you adjust to changes in your swallowing and speech. - Stay active as much as possible when you feel good. DO NOT overdo it when your energy is low. - Rest as needed during the day and avoid stress. - Use physical therapy and occupational therapy to help you stay independent and reduce the risk of falls. - Place handrails throughout your house to help prevent falls. Place them in bathrooms and along stairways. - Use assistive devices, when needed, to make movement easier. These devices may include special eating utensils, wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, and walkers. - Talk to a social worker or other counseling service to help you and your family cope with the disorder. These services can also help you get outside help, such as Meals on Wheels."
How to diagnose Parkinson's Disease?,"Parkinson disease (Diagnosis): There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help diagnose sporadic cases of Parkinson disease. The diagnosis is generally made after careful evaluation of medical history, current symptoms, and exclusion of other conditions. [1] The clinical findings of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia are highly suggestive of Parkinson disease. The genetic cause of some forms of Parkinson disease has been identified. In those cases, genetic testing may be utilized to identify affected family members. [5]"
What is Epilepsy?,"Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity—from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development—can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy."
What are the symptoms of Epilepsy?,"Epilepsy (Symptoms): Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You're experiencing heat exhaustion. - You're pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice."
How to diagnose Epilepsy?,"Epilepsy (Diagnosis): To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it's common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you're not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you're awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you're having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you've had an MRI and EEG that didn't pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment."

Hope get your help ASAP because he is in the first stage. and we have a we are all hope he will be better. Best Regards","Leigh syndrome (Treatment): Treatment of Leigh syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms present in each person. [6] Supportive care for Leigh syndrome includes treatment of acidosis, seizures , dystonia , and cardiomyopathy , and attention to nutritional status. [4] [3] Because anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and bring on respiratory failure, careful consideration should be given to its use and close monitoring prior to, during, and after its use. [4] [3] Progression and new symptoms should be monitored regularly (typically every 6-12 months). Evaluations with a neurologist , ophthalmologist , audiologist , and cardiologist are recommended. [4] [3] Specific treatment is possible for the three nuclear gene -encoded Leigh-like syndromes (milder conditions with similar features). These include biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), biotinidase deficiency, and coenzyme Q10 deficiency caused by mutation of PDSS2. [4] Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.

What is an electrochemical potential ?,It is when there is no net movement of ions because the electrical forces completely balance the diffusional forces
What does the sodium-potassium ATPase pump do ?,It maintains the gradient across the membrane at rest\nIt pumps against the concentration gradient so it uses ATP. It pumps 3 sodium ions out for every 2 potassium ions in
What are ion channels ?,Integral membrane proteins that are selectively permeable to certain ions Conduct small ionic currents
What are transporters/exchangers ?,Integral membrane proteins which either transport or exchange ions across the membrane Don’t have a pore so they don’t usually conduct ionic current
What are ion pumps ?,Integral membrane proteins Transport ions against their electrochemical gradient Requires ATP
How do voltage gated channels ?,They are very selective due to their gating mechanisms The gate opens/closes based up the potential The pore of these channels have selectivity filters enabling passage of specific ions Gate is connected to a voltage sensor which is sensitive to changes in voltage Gate opens upon conformational changes in the channel
Explain the potassium channel selectivity filter ?,In their pores they have a sequence which is an acidity filter and is highly conserved - TVGYGPotassium ions are surrounded by water molecules making it easier to diffuse in the cytosol The acidity filter in the pore mimics the hydration of the potassium ions so their for the oxygen moieties can interact and allow potassium to diffuse through the channel easily.Sodium also has water molecules surrounding it but because sodium is a smaller molecule the woxygen moieties are too far away to interact so sodium doesn’t pass through the potassium channel
What are the 2 gates present in sodium channels ?,M gate - activation gate which opens upon depolarisation to allow sodium ions to pass through the channel H gate - inactivation gate which activates just after the pore has been open to plug the pore so no more sodium ions can pass through  it remains activate for a while causing he refractory period so there is no more sodium influx
What is the voltage-clamp technique ?,1- an electrode is inserted into the neurone and this measures the membrane potential across it. This electrode is connected to a voltage clamp amplifier 2- voltage clamp amplifier compares the membrane potential of the neuron with the desired membrane potential3- if the membrane potential in the neuron is different from the desired membrane potential then the clamp amplifier injects current through another electrode 4- using a current measured the current which is injected to get the membrane potential to the desired potential is recorded

What is the current clamp technique ?,In this technique the current flowing across the membrane is controlled so the voltage can be recorded Useful for looking at actions potentials
When an action potential occurs why doesn’t the membrane potential reach the equilibrium potential of sodium ?,Because the sodium channels inactivate very quickly - their effects are transient
What is the role of sodium channels in the action potential ?,"They are voltage gated and open upon depolarisationOnce they open they enable and influx of sodium ions and this causes more sodium channels to open, the explosive influx only occurs if the threshold is reached - push the membrane potential towards their equilibrium potential but inactivate rapidly They remain inactivate during the refractory period preventing any further action potentials occurring They inactivate after about 1-2ms"
What is the role of the potassium channels in the action potential ?,The voltage potassium channels also open at depolarisation but at a more positive potential compared to sodium- they have slower kinetics that sodium channels This delayed opening of the potassium channels is fundamental in the repolarisation of the cellAt rest some voltage gated potassium channels are open and leak potassium channels are open and this is important for maintaining the membrane potential at rest
What are calcium-activated potassium channels ?,There are some potassium channels which react to the internal calcium concentration- they contribute to repolarisation of the cellThese channels are often in cells which contain the voltage calcium channels which contribute to depolarisation\nThese channels remain open longer than voltage gated potassium channels which is why they cause he undershoot of the action potential=afterhyperpolarsation
Why is an action potential normally unidirectional ?,Because the previous region that was depolarised can’t be depolarised straight away again because it is in its refractory period
In the CNS why are action potentials generally generated in the axon initial segment ?,Because this is where there is he highest concentration of sodium channels

"If the membrane potential is at +70mV and the potassium channels are opened, what happens to the epsc and epsp ?",The epsc will have an upward deflection because potassium ions will be flowing out of the cell to cause an outward current to return membrane potential closer to its equilibrium potential The epsp will be a downward deflection as the outward flow of current will cause the membrane potential to become more negative
"If the membrane potential was at - 70mV and chloride channels were opened, what would happen to the epsc and epsp ?","The epsc would be an upward deflection because chloride ions would be entering the cell The epsp would be a downward deflection because chloride ions would be making the membrane potential ,ore negative"

What happens to off centre bipolar cells when their is light in the centre ?,Photoreceptors is hyperpolarises reducing release of glutamate Less glutamate released onto AMPA kainate and NMDA receptors on bipolar cell so it causes hyperpolarisation of bipolar cellThis causes less release of glutamate from bipolar cell onto ganglion cell so it is also hyperpolarises
What happens to on centre bipolar cells when the centre is in the dark ?,Photoreceptors are depolarised in the dark so release lots of glutamate Glutamate binds to mGluR6 on bipolar cells and this causes closure of sodium channels causing hyperpolarisation of bipolar cellsLess glutamate is therefore released from bipolar cells onto ganglion cells so the ganglion cells are also hyperpolarises
What happens to off centre bipolar cells and ganglion cells when the centre is dark ?,Photoreceptor is depolarised so more glutamate is released More glutamate to act on glutamatertergic receptors on bipolar cell causes bipolar cell to depolarise This causes it to release flu ate onto ganglion cell and cause it to depolarise
